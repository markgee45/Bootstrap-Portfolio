  Mark Gee was born and raised in Austin, Texas, (he can ride a horse but he didnt learn in Texas). As a teenager Mark moved to Long Beach, California where he graduated high school from Woodrow Wilson High and surprisingly, as an athletic black dude, didn't play any sports. He brought great shame to his four brothers who all stand over six feet tall. He later relocated to San Diego, California, learn how to ride a horse. He majored in Electrical Engineering at San Diego State University where he also met his future ex-girlfriend a smoking hott exchange student from China.

  She promised him if he moved to the bay area and became a web developer, they would reconnect and start a family. Mark is now enrolled in U.C.Berkeley full stack web developing program and she canceled the international calling feature on her phone to save money.
  Mark cannot afford to pay his phone bill this month, he may have to drive for Uber or start a go fund me page. If he does not pay, T-Mobile assures him his service will be interrupted and he would have to pay the entire balance with a seventy dollar reconnect fee. Poor Bastard, stay focused, finish the program, and maybe his brothers will be proud of him if he get a job with Google.
